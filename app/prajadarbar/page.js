      The article provides an overview of the commencement of the "Praja Darbar"
      at Jyotirao Phule Praja Bhavan in Hyderabad, Telangana. Here's a summary:
      1. **Event Overview:** - The Praja Darbar event started at Jyotirao Phule
      Praja Bhavan, previously known as Pragati Bhavan, a day after Chief
      Minister A. Revanth Reddy assumed charge. 2. **Historical Context:** - The
      article draws a comparison with the era of late Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy
      when people from across the state used to gather at the venue to meet the
      Chief Minister personally with their grievances. 3. **Change in
      Accessibility:** - The atmosphere at the Praja Bhavan is described as
      contrasting with the past, where the once impenetrable fortress now gives
      a sense of freedom, with the imposing gates now welcoming people. 4.
      **People's Expectations:** - People stood in queues with representations
      and hope, expressing their anticipation for a new beginning in governance
      under the Congress government. 5. **Grievances and Stories:** -
      Individuals at the Praja Darbar shared various grievances, ranging from
      land issues to complaints against uncooperative officials, job denials,
      and housing shortages. 6. **History of Praja Darbar:** - The practice of
      Praja Darbar was initiated by Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy in 2004, where he
      would meet officials and the public regularly. The tradition continued
      until his tragic accident in 2009. 7. **Political Changes:** - Subsequent
      Chief Ministers, including K. Rosaiah and Kiran Kumar Reddy, continued the
      practice, but it dwindled over time. 8. **Changes in Venue:** - The
      article highlights the shift of the Chief Minister's camp office from the
      old location to Pragati Bhavan after the formation of Telangana. Pragati
      Bhavan was, however, reportedly not accessible to the public. 9.
      **Symbolic Gesture:** - In a symbolic gesture, the iron grills around
      Pragati Bhavan were razed to the ground, indicating a willingness to
      demolish barriers between the Chief Minister and the public. 10. **Praja
      Darbar under Revanth Reddy:** - Chief Minister Revanth Reddy announced the
      Praja Darbar, expressing openness to the public. The event was held in the
      Praja Bhavan, where people could present their grievances directly. Please
